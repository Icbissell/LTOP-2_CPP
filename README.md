## About
   LTOP-2 is a general program to simulate the steady state precipitation field with orographic lifting over a user defined topography. This repository contains the C++ scripts under 'LTOP-2_CPP' as well as a CMake file with two examples (a simple Gaussian hill and a section of the Himalayan shelf) under 'LTOP-2_CMAKE'. Instructions for setting up the CMake script are included in its respective README file. 

## Abstract
   
## Getting the code
   You can download both the CMake file and LTOP-2 source files by navigating to your desired folder and running:
   
         git clone https://github.com/Icbissell/LTOP-2_CPP.git
